I've used DaVinci Resolve for some time, but I had a few painful issues with it:
1. It often crashed and/or crashed the GPU driver, often requiring a reboot.
2. It failed to detect my sound devices.
3. Rendering was slow.

Vegas Pro 19, surprisingly for some, has none of these issues, and comes along with bonuses such as:
- Easy-to-use interface

- Sound Forge integration
- GPU Rendering[^1]
- Actually usable Pan/Crop and Plugin Chains

And best of all, it has sales frequently! So I included it in [[Posts/My Toolbox\|My Toolbox]].

	Vegas supports Intel QSV on my config.
