A lot of programs are really fussy when it comes to `cobalt.tools` and videos downloaded with it.
Use Remux or any converter.

In Settings, set the [filename style](https://cobalt.tools/settings/download#filename) to Basic for better readability.

Settings only work for YT videos (tested with 小红书).
