AnimHelper is a PowerPoint tool I made for faster animation.

I used it to create the first version of my [[Posts/Card Game Scheme\|Card Game]].
Sure, it's not the best of my projects, but it did it's job.

***Functions:***

Self-Animate: Select an object to assign it an animation and set the trigger to itself.
Animate with a Trigger: Select an object, and then a trigger. The animation will be assigned to your first object with the second one as the trigger.
Self-Animate Multiple: Each selected object will be assigned an animation with the trigger set to itself.
Animate Multiple with a Trigger: Select multiple objects, and then a trigger. The animation will be assigned to all of your selected objects with the last one as the trigger.
