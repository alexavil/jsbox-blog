_(This is the original version of the Future Perfect page for an unfinished project created in 2021. Feel free to use it for educational purposes.)_

Future Perfect is used when we talk about an action that will be completed before some point in the future. In other words, the actions have a deadline. The deadline can be very specific (eight o’clock) or it can be vague (next week). It can even depend on when something else happens. It just has to be some time in the future.

We can visualize it on a timeline like this:

Some clues for Future Perfect include: \_by the time, by..., before, as soon as, etc.

> [!Info]  
> We form a positive sentence in Future Perfect like this: **will (’ll) have + Past Participle**

> [!Warning]  
> Remember: we never use the form **has**!

For regular verbs, we simply add -ed. Bear in mind you need to remember the irregular verbs.

Here are some examples of this:

- **I will have finished this project by 8 o’clock.** _(maybe earlier)_
- **She will have left our town by next week.** _(could be on any day)_
- **They will have spent all their money by the end of this year.**
- **Mike will have painted the walls by the time she arrives.**

> [!Info]  
> We form a negative sentence in Future Perfect like this: **will not (won’t) have + Past Participle**

Here are some examples:

- **I won’t have finished this project by 8 o’clock.** _(I need more time)_
- **She won’t have left our town by next week.** _(she decided to stay longer)_
- **They won’t have spent all their money by the end of this year.** _(they’ll save up instead)_
- **Mike won’t have painted the walls by the time she arrives.** _(he spent a while choosing the paint)_

> [!Info]  
> We form a question in Future Perfect like this: **will + (subject) + have + Past Participle.** We answer these questions like in Future Simple.

Observe carefully:

- **Will I** **have finished this project by 8 o’clock? - Yes, I will./No, I won’t.**
- **Will she have left our town by next week? - Yes, she will./No, she won’t.**
- **Will they have spent all their money by the end of this year? - Yes, they will./No, they won’t.**
- **Will Mike have painted the walls by the time she arrives? - Yes, he will./No, he won’t.**

To sum it up, here’s a table with all the forms:

| Sentence | Form                                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Positive | will (’ll) have + Past Participle (-ed)         |
| Negative | will not (won’t) have + Past Participle (-ed)   |
| Question | will + (subject) + have + Past Participle (-ed) |
