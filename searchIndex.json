		"content": "(This is the original version of the Future Perfect page for an unfinished project created in 2021. Feel free to use it for educational purposes.)\nFuture Perfect is used when we talk about an action that will be completed before some point in the future. In other words, the actions have a deadline. The deadline can be very specific (eight o’clock) or it can be vague (next week). It can even depend on when something else happens. It just has to be some time in the future.\nWe can visualize it on a timeline like this:\n\nSome key words for Future Perfect include: by the time, by ..., before, as soon as, etc.\n\n[!Info]\nWe form a positive sentence in Future Perfect like this: will (’ll) have + Past Participle\n\n[!Warning]\nRemember: we never use the form has!\n\nFor regular verbs, we simply add -ed. Bear in mind you need to remember the irregular verbs.\nHere are some examples of this:\n\nI will have finished this project by 8 o’clock. (maybe earlier)\nShe will have left our town by next week. (could be on any day)\nThey will have spent all their money by the end of this year.\nMike will have painted the walls by the time she arrives.\n\n[!Info]\nWe form a negative sentence in Future Perfect like this: will not (won’t) have + Past Participle\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nI won’t have finished this project by 8 o’clock. (I need more time)\nShe won’t have left our town by next week. (she decided to stay longer)\nThey won’t have spent all their money by the end of this year. (they’ll save up instead)\nMike won’t have painted the walls by the time she arrives. (he spent a while choosing the paint)\n\n[!Info]\nWe form a question in Future Perfect like this: will + (subject) + have + Past Participle. We answer these questions like in Future Simple.\n\nObserve carefully:\n\nWill I have finished this project by 8 o’clock? - Yes, I will./No, I won’t.\nWill she have left our town by next week? - Yes, she will./No, she won’t.\nWill they have spent all their money by the end of this year? - Yes, they will./No, they won’t.\nWill Mike have painted the walls by the time she arrives? - Yes, he will./No, he won’t.\n\nTo sum it up, here’s a table with all the forms:\n\nSentence\nForm\n\nPositive\nwill (’ll) have + Past Participle (-ed)\n\nNegative\nwill not (won’t) have + Past Participle (-ed)\n\nQuestion\nwill + (subject) + have + Past Participle (-ed)\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/\">Home</a>",
